Zero Food Waste Recipes is a full-stack AI-powered cooking assistant designed to help users reduce food waste and create smarter meal choices using the ingredients they already have. This project integrates a beautifully crafted React frontend with a scalable Node.js + Express backend and MongoDB for data storage. Users can add, save, delete, and manage their own recipes while also interacting with an intelligent AI chatbot—Chat-Cook, powered by OpenAI—to receive instant recipe suggestions, substitution ideas, and zero-waste cooking advice. The entire platform is built with a clean UI, modern design, and a focus on sustainability, making everyday cooking easier, efficient, and eco-friendly.
