# Zero-Food-Waste-Recipes-project
A web app where users input available ingredients.  An AI model (OpenAI/Llama) generates creative recipes using those ingredients.  The app can also fetch structured recipes from APIs (like Spoonacular) for validation.  Adds expiry tracking + donation suggestions to reduce waste further.
